# SQL-Sales-Report
# In this project i took data from AdventureWorks and worked on a sample database. We will be working on creating some tables and cleaning the data to make it easier to work on when we do Power BI visualization. And then we have to organize our work and what we want to get out of this dataset. For example Internet Sales Report, what product is the most sold (Top 10), which customers are spending more (Top 10), and this has to be over a period of time. Also measure budget and KPI's. I will post pictures of the Power BI here with the relationship table and the dashboard.
